            Unlike a <b>@:(sessions.register.types.compliance.title)</b>
            session, you can execute tests as many times as desired, and can

        description: >-
          A <b>@:(sessions.register.types.test.title)</b> session allows you to
          select the precise test cases to execute, without completing a
          questionnaire. You can execute each test case as many times as
          desired, and can change the set of selected test cases at any time.

        description: >-
          A <b>@:(sessions.register.types.compliance.title)</b> is designed to
          be executed once you are confident in your system. You will only be
          able to execute each test case <b>{testRunAttempts}</b> times, and you
          will not be able to adjust the test case selection once the session is
          created. After executing your tests, you will be able to submit your
          results for review by a platform administrator.
