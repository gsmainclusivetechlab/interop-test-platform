name: Bulk Disbursement - retrieve completed transactions - failure (identifier error)
slug: bulk-disbursement-retrieve-completed-transactions-failure-identifier-error
use_case: Disbursements (New)
behavior: negative
description: |
  The Service Provider wants to test if he is capable of retrieving details of completed transactions in previously made bulk disbursement from their account with MMO. In this case, we simulate the scenario when the Service Provider (the Payer) would like to retrieve only the completed set of transactions for a batch. This flow shows the necessary steps for this request simulating an error in the retrieval due to invalide batch ID.
