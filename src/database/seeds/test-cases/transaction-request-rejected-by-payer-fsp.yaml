name: Transaction Request Rejected by Payer FSP
use_case: Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment
behavior: positive
description: |
  The Service Provider wants to test if he is capable of receiving a transaction from a different wallet.
  In this case, we simulate the scenario when the Payer would like to buy goods or services from a Service Provider (the Payee), but each of them uses different wallet providers.
  This flow shows the necessary steps for this transaction, simulating a reject status during the transaction requested by the Payer.

  Service Provider is capable of handled async calls.
  Payee and Payer MMOs exist in Mojaloop as Participants.
  Payee and Payer exist in Mojaloop as Parties.
