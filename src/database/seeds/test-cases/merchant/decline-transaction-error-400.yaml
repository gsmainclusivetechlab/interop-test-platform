name: Decline Transaction with Error 400 by Payee FSP
use_case: Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment

description: |
  The Service Provider wants to test if he is capable of receiving a transaction from a different wallet. In this case, we simulate the scenario when the Payer would like to buy goods or services from a Service Provider (the Payee), but each of them uses different wallet providers. This flow shows the necessary steps for this transaction, simulating a decline transaction with error 400 by the Payee.
